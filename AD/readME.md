This directory contains information relevant to the AD GWAS fine-mapping.

Summary statistics were found using PAN-UKBB. They have a [table of tested phenotypes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AeeADtT0U1AukliiNyiVzVRdLYPkTbruQSk38DeutU8/edit#gid=1450719288) and I used the wget commands from that to download the Alzheimer's/Dimentia summary statistics. Information on number of samples and cases can be found in the document.

LD matrices for this cohort have been harder to access (likely due to size). Using 1KGP EUR as a surogate has been alright but could be much improved.  

Scripts and figures related to this fine-mapping will be placed here as well. I am focusing on the [APOE locus](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/ApoE)
